Answer the following Questions in 1to 2 lines .


● Question 1: What is Pandas, and why is it commonly used in data cleaning tasks?
Ans : Pandas is library in python, which works on series and dataframe, pandas has many more features to manipulate the data and has features to import data. Pandas library is usefull for data scientists working on datasets. 


● Question 2: Given a DataFrame with missing values, how would you check for missing
values in each column and count the total number of missing values?
Ans : If there is a dataframe with missing values we'll write code [data.isnull().sum()]


● Question 3: How can you remove duplicates from a DataFrame while retaining the first
occurrence of each unique row?
Ans : drop_duplicates() will retain the first occurence of a duplicate row and remove duplicates


● Question 4: If you have a DataFrame with a column containing string values, how can
you convert all the values in that column to lowercase?
Ans : str.lower() function can be used to lowercase all the values of that particular column.


● Question 5: How do you replace missing values in a DataFrame with a specific value,
like 0, for a particular column?
Ans : data.fillna() function can be used to replace the missing values in dataframe with specific value .


● Question 6: If you have a DataFrame with a datetime column, how can you extract the
year, month, and day into separate columns?
Ans : If we have a datetime column we'll be able to create 3 different columns of year, month and day by using the code 1)for Year data['Year'] = data['Date'].dt.year,
2) for month data['Month'] = data['Date'].dt.month,
3)for day data['Day'] = data['Date'].dt.day


● Question 7: How can you filter rows in a DataFrame where a specific column's values
meet a certain condition (e.g., all rows where 'age' is greater than 30)?
Ans : We can directly apply the comparison operator to the column to filter the row.


● Question 8: What is the purpose of the .apply() function in Pandas, and how would you
use it to create a new column based on values from existing columns?
Ans : Apply function can be used to apply any built-in or created function to the column, using .apply() function we can use the built-in function of finding square root from numpy and using it to create a new column naming square root .
Code: data['Column1'].apply(np.sqrt)
data['Column2']=data['Column1'].apply(np.sqrt)

● Question 9: Suppose you want to merge two DataFrames, 'df1' and 'df2,' on a common
column 'key.' How would you perform this merge operation in Pandas?
Ans : We will directly use the merge function to merge the dataframe , we'll write code
data=pd.merge(df1,df2,on='key',how='inner')


● Question 10: You have a DataFrame with a column containing messy text data. How can
you clean and standardize the text data (e.g., remove punctuation and convert to
lowercase) in that column?
Ans : We can standardize the text by firstly creating a function
def clean_text(column_name):
    column_name = column_name.lower()
    column_name = column_name.translate(str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))
    return column_name
after this apply this function to the column 
data['new_column']=data['column_name'].apply(clean_text)
